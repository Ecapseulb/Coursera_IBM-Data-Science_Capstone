## Introduction
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is beacuse SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

**Our main goal is to build a model to predict whether the first stage of SpaceX Falcon 9 will land successfully.**

## Methodology
### There are 8 Jupyter Notebook files for all project
- Data Collection
- Data Webscraoing
- Data Wrangling
- EDA SQL
- EDA Datavisualization
- Launch Site (Folium)
- Dashboard
- Machine Learning Prediction
  - Logistic regression
  - Support vector machine
  - Decision tree
  - K nearest neighbors

## Results & Final Presentation
All models have the same accuracy of 0.833.

There is a final presentation pdf file. In this file, we have a complete report of the entire project.
